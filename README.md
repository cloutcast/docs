## Why we made CloutCast.

People have come to the Bitclout platform in droves because they're sick of 2010s era social media.

ðŸ‘Ž Getting peppered with targeted ads for things in your recent search history.

&#128078; Pouring energy into building a platform that you can't monetize.

And the list of &#128078;'s goes on.

We here at CloutCast said fuck that. We want to pull the plug on the current targeted advertising model that's eaten all of the social space today. We want ads to be dumb. We want ads to be silly. We want people to promote others genuinely and get promoted through their creativity.

And most importantly, we wholeheartedly agree with the bitclout man-god @artz: 
No Jack. No Zuck. No Evan.


## What the hell is CloutCast?

We are the first **Promoted Post** engine for the Bitclout ecosystem.

CloutCast provides a monetary incentive to promote others & a means for anyone to scale up their platform from scratch.

Our goals are simple:

1. Enable high clout individuals a means to monetize the very act of helping rising stars grow their platforms.
2. Enable newcomers the ability to get air-time in high clout networks in order to grow their platform.
3. Build a cool Bitclout feature that the entire community enjoys using for playing social games and engaging their HODLRs and followers in fun ways.
4. Never, for any reason, enable targeted advertising based on user data.

## How does it work?

### Promoters

Anyone can be a promoter. Like club promoters, but less mesh shirts and better pay.

Whether someone has send you a promotion link, or you find some promotions you're willing to promote on the CloutCast wall- you simply:

1. Check out the promotion to see the payout
2. Do the promoted engagement (comment, reclout, or quote) on [bitclout.com](http://bitclout.com), [cloutted.com](http://cloutted.com), or your favorite bitclout app
3. Copy the link from that engagement, and claim your payout on CloutCast!

### Clients

Anyone can be a client. Being a client simply means that you are paying for a promotion of a given clout. Maybe its your new startup that you're trying to scale, or a clever post from a creator you've invested in. Doesn't matter, if its a clout, you can promote it!

### &#128181; Money In & Money Out &#128181;

100% of the promotions and payouts occur in $Bitclout. So you simply transfer in sufficient $Bticlout in order to create promotions. Get paid for "running" or enagaging with promotions into your wallet. And can withdraw funds at any point back to your Bitclout Wallet tied to your public key.


## Recommended Use Cases for the Bitclout Community

1. The philanthropist.

    We're really hoping that this takes off as the primary use case. Anyone can announce on bitclout something like "I will reclout any post (provided it is tasteful) from highest bidder on [cloutcast.io](http://cloutcast.io) with all proceeds going to {{my charity of choice}}. Auction will end at 9PM EST today".

2. Mass Market Promotion

    Most straight forward. High Clout Individuals and Marketers run promotions with $$ payouts to boost their message or brands visibility in the bitclout ecosystem. An example of this would be an influencer that is new to bitclout running a some promotions on their clouts to get the word out that they are on the platform.

3. The Bootstraper

    The vast majority of creators have relatively low coin values and followers. CloutCast serves the community by letting them take some of their bitclout gains and growth hack using their creativity. **We really want creators to generate revenue by coming up with creative ways to get High Clout Individuals to run their promotions.** 

    Just write a clever clout, create a promotion for it, and DM that link to some "influencers"  in your target audience with a clean ask for them to run it and claim the payout.
    
4. Game Theory

    The CloutCast team likes this one the most, personally. There are millions of games one could dream up to engage your followers leveraging this system. We honestly cannot wait to see what some of the clever minded creators dream up and run on CloutCast. 

    Examples such as:

    *  "For $20 I will quote reclout the best rap battle insult against me with my rap battle response, roast me. Entries will be reviewed at 6PM PT on cloutcast.io"
